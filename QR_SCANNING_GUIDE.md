# QR Code Scanning Guide - Cognizant Pre-Placement Talk

## 🎯 **Problem Solved!**

The QR codes now work with **both Google Lens and our web scanner**, and properly display student information when scanned.

## 📱 **How to Scan QR Codes**

### Method 1: Using Google Lens (Recommended for Mobile)

1. **Open Google Lens** on your phone
2. **Point camera at QR code**
3. **Tap the QR code result** - it will show a URL like:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/validate/42f22478e3e03c076e32fbc705b9d7af5a48d181f3e2194430f6ee7572c16725
   ```
4. **Tap the URL** to open in browser
5. **See student information displayed**:
   - ✅ Student Name
   - ✅ PRN Number  
   - ✅ Email Address
   - ✅ Attendance Status
6. **Dashboard automatically updates** with the scan

### Method 2: Using Web Scanner Interface

2. **Click "Start Camera"**
3. **Point camera at QR code**

5. **Dashboard updates in real-time**

### Method 3: Manual Entry (Backup)

4. **Click Validate** to process
